# Module-14-Challenge
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.


# Step 6: Use an Alternative ML Model and Evaluate Strategy Returns
In this section, you’ll tune, or adjust, the model’s input features to find the parameters that result in the best trading outcomes. You’ll choose the best by comparing the cumulative products of the strategy returns.

Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset.

To do so, slice your data into different periods. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file.

Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?


Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.

Adjust one or both of the windows for the algorithm. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file.


Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

Step 3: Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns.

Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns, and document your conclusion in your README.md file.
